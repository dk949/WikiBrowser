# WikiReader mod for tModLoader
## Completed Features
* Drop an item in a dialogue window to get its wiki page


## Required bugfixes:
* String wrapping
  * There is currently no wrapping, each paragraph is a long string going off screen.
* Pagination
  * The text just goes off the bottom of the screen
* Background/frame
  * Text is really hard to read without it
  
## Missing features which could be considered to be bugs
* If an Item does not have an individual page nothing is loaded.
  * E.g. "Chlorophyte Mask" should redirect to "Chlorophyte armor", but currently does not.
* Some sections are blank.
  * "== Crafting ==" is always blank 
* Whenever there are are differences between versions, on the wiki they are displayed as
  [Value 1] {icon} {icon}/[value 2] {icon} {icon} {icon}, this currently gets translated as 
  [value1]   /[value 2]   
  * There is no indication as to which version values belong to
  * E.g.
    * "Crafting the full set with every helmet type requires 78 bars
      ( {icon} 390 / {icon} {icon} {icon} {icon}468 ore). " ->
    * "Crafting the full set with every helmet type requires 78 bars
      ( 390 /    468 ore). 
      
## Nice-to-have features
* Allow the user to type the name of an item/npc if they can't place them in the window.
* (maybe) allow hovering over items/NPCs and pressing a key to get the article about the thing under the cursor
